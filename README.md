# On-Car-Vibration-Based-Harvester-Simulation
The simulation for vibration-based harvester mounted on car. Served as my Final Year Project.

# Structure of the project
The project is mainly divided into two parts:
1. Vibration-based harvester mounted on car simulation using Unity3D
2. Utilities including terrain generation, data collection and power prediction.
You can find the README for each module here:
