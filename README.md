# On-Car-Vibration-Based-Harvester-Simulation
The simulation for vibration-based harvester mounted on car. Served as my Final Year Project.

# Structure of the project
The project is mainly divided into two parts:
1. Vibration-based harvester mounted on car simulation using Unity3D
2. Utilities including terrain generation, data collection and power prediction.

You can find the README for each module here:
- [Power Predictor](PowerPredictor/README.md)
- [Terrain Generation](TerrainGeneration/README.md)
- [Vibration-based Harvester Simulation](VibrationBasedHarvesterSimulationUnity3D/README.md)

# Portable Version for the simulator
I have also made a portable simulator (in exe) that can be used as a demo.
